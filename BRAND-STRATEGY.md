# PrimeBridge Finance — Brand & Strategy Document

**Version 1.0 | Confidential**

---

## Executive Summary

PrimeBridge Finance is a two-sided private-credit marketplace where fintech lenders sell bank-originated consumer loans to accredited investors through a fully automated platform with underwriting, compliance, and transparency built in.

**The 10-Second Pitch:**
> We're AngelList for private credit. Fintechs originate loans, investors buy them, and PrimeBridge automates the entire pipeline end-to-end — legal, banking, underwriting, and transparency — so capital flows instantly without middlemen.

---

## Part 1: Brand Identity

### Name
**PrimeBridge Finance**

### Tagline
> Institutional-grade private credit, without the Wall Street gatekeepers.

### One-Liner
> A marketplace where fintech lenders sell loan pools and accredited investors access high-yield private credit, all through a transparent, automated platform.

### Core Promise
> We automate the loan sale pipeline — from origination to investor allocation — so lenders get instant liquidity and investors get clean, analyzed deals.

## Part 2: Target Audiences

### Fintech Lenders (Sellers)
- Consumer lending fintechs (personal loans, auto, BNPL, medical)
- Monthly origination volume $1M+
- Need capital without warehouse lines
- Bank-partner model for loan origination
- Want to focus on origination, not capital raising

### Accredited Investors (Buyers)
- Family offices, RIAs, small funds
- Accredited individuals ($200K+ income or $1M+ net worth)
- Searching for yield in private credit (12-20%+)
- Want loan-level transparency, not black-box funds
- Short duration preference (3-24 months)

---

## Part 3: Competitive Positioning

### What We Are
A three-sided private-credit infrastructure platform connecting:
1. **Fintech lenders** (who need capital)
2. **Bank partner** (who legally originates the loans)
3. **Accredited investors** (who want yield)

Automating the entire pipeline:
- Underwriting
- Loan purchase & sale
- Bank hold period
- Investor allocation
- Reporting & compliance
- On-chain audit trail

### What We Are NOT
- Not a private credit fund (like Jovian)
- Not an investment storefront (like Yieldstreet)
- Not a single-sided marketplace (like Percent)
- Not a lender (like banks)
- Not SaaS-only software (like loan platforms)

### Most Similar To
- **AngelList** — for private credit
- **Pipe** — for consumer loans
- **Percent** — for transparency
- Plus **bank partner origination** for legal compliance

### Competitive Matrix

| Company | What They Are | Gap | Overlap | Why We Win |
|---------|---------------|-----|---------|------------|
| Jovian Capital | Private credit fund | No platform, no automation | 10% | We're infrastructure, not a fund |
| Percent.com | Investment marketplace | No lender onboarding, slow | 40% | We open access to ANY lender & investor |
| Pipe (early) | Revenue financing marketplace | No consumer loans, no bank partner | 50% | Loan-level trading with bank origination |
| AngelList | VC deal marketplace | Not credit, no underwriting | 60% | AngelList but for private credit |
| Yieldstreet/Fundrise | Retail alt-investment | No loan marketplace | 15% | Multi-sided and automated |
| Banks | Loan originators | No marketplace, slow | 5% | We use bank partner but transcend banking limits |

**Conclusion:** No direct competitor is building the full marketplace + compliance pipeline like PrimeBridge.

## Part 4: Why This Hasn't Been Built

### The Gap Nobody Else Can Fill

**1. Credit People Can't Code**
Private-credit operators understand underwriting but run their business on Excel, PDFs, email threads, and manual processes. They can price loans but cannot build scalable software.

**2. Tech Founders Don't Understand Credit**
Silicon Valley founders avoid this space because they don't understand bank sponsorship, loan sale agreements, usury law workarounds, servicing vs. sub-servicing, or expected-loss models. They build neobanks and apps, not infrastructure.

**3. This Is a Three-Sided Marketplace**
Building PrimeBridge requires understanding all three sides:
- Fintech lenders
- Bank originators
- Accredited investors

99% of founders only understand one.

**4. Regulatory Fear**
KYC/AML, bank partners, loan transfers, compliance audits — most founders run away from this. But compliance is not the blocker; it's the backbone.

**5. The Bank Origination Model Was Never Productized**
Everyone knows Utah/NJ banks allow national lending. Nobody thought to turn "hold for 5 days → sell → repackage → resell" into an automated platform. This is the unlock.

**6. Existing Players Stopped Halfway**
Percent, Pipe, AngelList — each solved parts of the problem, but no one connected the entire pipeline from lender → bank → investor.

**7. It's "Boring" to VCs**
Private credit is boring, operational, compliance-heavy, and misunderstood. But boring infrastructure is where the biggest businesses are built (Stripe, Plaid, Marqeta, Adyen).

### The Pitch Line
> "PrimeBridge exists because the teams with credit expertise don't know how to build platforms — and the teams who can build platforms don't know how credit works. We do."

## Part 5: Market Opportunity

### Why Now

**1. Private Credit Is Exploding**
- $1.7 trillion in 2023 → projected $3.5T+ by 2028
- Institutions are over-allocated
- Accredited investors have zero direct access

**2. Fintech Lenders Need New Liquidity**
Higher interest rates mean banks are pulling back, credit funds are marking up spreads, and lenders are stuck with more demand than capital.

**3. Regulatory Environment Favors Bank-Sponsor Models**
The NJ/UT bank model is now the default for consumer lending. PrimeBridge productizes it for the entire market.

**4. Yield Demand Has Never Been Higher**
Accredited investors want short duration, high yield, transparent risk, and alternatives to stocks/real estate.

**5. AI + Automation Make This Possible**
Automate KYC/AML, credit scoring, documentation, investor allocation, repayments, and reporting. This was impossible 5 years ago.

### Market Size

| Metric | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **TAM** | $3.5T | Global private credit + consumer/SMB lending |
| **SAM** | $250B | Fintech-originated loans eligible for secondary sale |
| **SOM** | $5-10B | Capturable in 5-7 years with 200-400 lenders, 5,000-10,000 investors |

**Revenue at $5B volume:** $100-200M annually (2-4% platform fee) with almost zero balance-sheet risk.

## Part 7: Business Model

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Rate | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Loan Transaction Fee | 2-4% | Paid by lender for liquidity |
| Servicing Spread | 40-200 bps | Ongoing servicing revenue |
| Investor Platform Fee | 0.25-0.75% | Annual fee on AUA |

## Part 8: Team Advantage

### Why We Win Where Others Haven't

1. **Domain knowledge across all 3 sides** — Fintech lenders, investors, AND bank partners

2. **Technical ability** — Turn back-office credit workflows into APIs

3. **Infrastructure mindset** — Funds scale linearly; marketplaces scale exponentially

4. **Speed + adaptability** — No legacy systems, no manual teams, no fund overhead

5. **Zero balance sheet risk** — Monetize flow, not leverage

6. **Modern tech stack** — Supabase + Stripe + AI underwriting

7. **Insider understanding** — Turn the NJ/UT bank model into a marketplace product

---

## Part 9: Differentiators

### The Right Market Gap
Consumer loan pools of $1-50M are too small for securitization but too fragmented for direct institutional buyers. PrimeBridge fills this gap.

### Full Pipeline Automation
From loan origination → bank hold → pool upload → investor allocation → payments. No manual handoffs, no email chains.

### Bank-Partner Compliance Built-In
Every loan is bank-originated with proper hold periods. True lender compliance is the foundation, not an afterthought.

### Loan-Level Transparency
Investors see full loan tapes, FICO distributions, delinquency rates, and static pool analysis. No black boxes.

### Aligned Incentives
We earn when loans perform — transaction fees on flow, not AUM fees that incentivize complexity.
